# **Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System**

## **Project Description**

The "Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System" is a robust digital ecosystem designed to enhance the safety of tourists in high-risk and remote areas, particularly in regions like Northeast India. It leverages a combination of AI, Blockchain, and Geo-Fencing technologies to provide a proactive and rapid response framework for tourist safety.

The system aims to replace traditional, manual tracking methods with a smart, technology-driven solution that ensures real-time monitoring, secure identity verification, and rapid incident response, all while upholding data privacy.

## **Key Features**

* **Digital Tourist ID Generation:** A secure, blockchain-based platform for issuing tamper-proof digital IDs to tourists. These IDs contain verified KYC information, trip itineraries, and emergency contacts, and are valid for the duration of the visit.  
* **Mobile Application for Tourists:** A user-friendly mobile app that auto-assigns a Tourist Safety Score, provides Geo-fencing alerts for high-risk zones, and includes a one-click Panic Button for live location sharing with law enforcement and emergency contacts.  
* **AI-Based Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes AI models to detect unusual behavior, such as sudden location changes or prolonged inactivity, to flag potential distress situations for immediate investigation.  
* **Tourism & Police Dashboard:** A real-time web-based dashboard for authorities to visualize tourist movements via heat maps, access digital ID records, and automatically generate e-FIRs for missing person cases.  
* **Multilingual Support:** The mobile app and platform will be available in English and multiple Indian languages to ensure accessibility for all travelers.  
* **Data Privacy & Security:** Ensures end-to-end encryption and compliance with data protection laws. Blockchain technology guarantees that identity and travel records are secure and tamper-proof.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (for modern UI), JavaScript  
* **Backend:** Node.js, Python (for AI/ML models)  
* **Database:** Blockchain technology for secure, decentralized identity storage.  
* **Other:** AI/ML for behavior analysis, Geo-Fencing APIs, IoT integration (optional).
